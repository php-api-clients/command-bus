Light weight wrapper around [`league/tactician`](http://tactician.thephpleague.com/) adding [`promised`](https://github.com/reactphp/promise) based interface(s) and next tick execution.

# Installation

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `^`.

```
composer require api-clients/command-bus 
```

# Usage

Simply pass the command bus a [`ReactPHP` event loop](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop) and a `CommandHandlerMiddleware` and it will run each handle in a future tick on the passed event loop.

```PHP
$commandHandlerMiddleware = new CommandHandlerMiddleware(/*...*/);
$commandBus = new CommandBus(
    $container->get(LoopInterface::class),
    $commandHandlerMiddleware
);
```

There is one note though, command handlers are encouraged to return promises them self.
